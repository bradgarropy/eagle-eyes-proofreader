        quote: "Having Heather as part of my publishing team has been a game-changer. For indie authors, putting out a professional, polished book makes all the difference in the world. And no matter how many rounds of edits or how many ARC readers get their eyes on your manuscript, it seems something always slips through the cracks. Heather is amazing when it comes to spotting those little typos and inconsistencies that can make an otherwise terrific book seem amateurish. Her proofreading has taken the quality of my books to a different level. It's not a bad thing when people think they've come through a traditional publishing house.",

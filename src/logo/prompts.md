Generate a square or rectangular shaped logo for Eagle Eyes Proofreader, a proofreading company for authors and books. Try to incorporate a red squiggly line as a proofreading and spell checking metaphor. Try to incorporate an eagle somehow. Make the design very simple, as few lines and curves as possible. Should be easily recognizable as a logo. The logo should be slightly friendly and playful, not serious and overbearing. The eagle should be cute, and the squiggly line should look like it's underlining a word.
